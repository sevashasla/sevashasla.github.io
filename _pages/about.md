## About me
I am passionate about 3D Computer Vision and Generative Models. Currently, I am a 1st-year M.Sc. student in Data Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch), one of the **Top 10** universities in Europe ([Times Higher Education](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-europe)).  

As a research student at [CVLab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/), I focus on **Gaussian Splatting** and **Diffusion Models**. My experience includes multiple internships in both research and industry, allowing me to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications.  

<!-- I hold a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and Physics from [MIPT](https://eng.mipt.ru), the top-ranked Computer Science university in Russia ([MIPT](https://eng.mipt.ru)).   -->


<!-- Previously, I was a visiting student at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/) a research intern at [MIPT](https://cogmodel.mipt.ru/eng), and a machine learning engineering intern at [Yandex](https://yandex.com/company?).  -->
